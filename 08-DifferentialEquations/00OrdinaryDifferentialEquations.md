# 8. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) 

In this exercise we will look at how to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerically. We will cover the following topics:
1. [Introduction to ODEs](Introduction-to-ODEs)
2. [Understanding Ordinary Differential Equations - Direction Fields](understanding-ordinary-differential-equations-direction-fields)
3. [Introduction to Numerically solving Ordinary Differential Equations - Euler Method](intro-to-odes-euler-method)
4. [Stability and Stiffness of Numerical Methods](stability-and-stiffness)
5. [Higher Order Methods to solve ODEs](highest-order-solvers)

This exerxise is based on the follwing sources: https://kyleniemeyer.github.io/ME373-book/content/intro.html. This is only a short introduction on how to solve ODEs using numerical methods.

This is a complete lecture with accompanying youtube videos (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNTYaOnVI3QpH7jgULnAmvPA) on ODEs and numerical methods to solve them.
