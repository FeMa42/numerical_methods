### Machine Learning and Foundations:

[Matrix Cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf)
Formula collection for matrix calculation

[Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)

Chapter 5 is interesting for us:

- Section 5.1 Differentiation of Univariate Functions
- Section 5.2 Partial Differentiation and Gradients
- Section 5.3 Gradients of Vector-Valued Functions
- Section 5.4 Gradients of Matrices
- Section 5.5 Useful Identities for Computing Gradients
- Section 5.6 Backpropagation and Automatic Differentiation
- Section 5.7 Higher-Order Derivatives
- Section 5.8 Linearization and Multivariate Taylor Series 

[Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html)
Beautifully written book on Machine Learning with a good overview of mathematical foundations.

[Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html)
Advanced topics in Probabilistic Machine Learning. These are indeed advanced topics and much is very close to the current state of research (Challenging but exciting).

### Julia Material (only necessary if you want to continue to engage with it after the course):
