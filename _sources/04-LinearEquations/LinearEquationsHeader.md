# 4. Linear Equations 
In this exercise we will look at solving linear equations. This is a frequently encountered task in engineering and science. For example we need to solve a linear equation to find the root of a function using the Newton method. We will look closer at the following Topics: 

1. [Linear Algebra in Julia](linear-algebra-in-julia)
2. [Conditioning of linear equations](conditioning-of-linear-equations)
3. [Gaussian Elimination](gaussian-elimination)
4. [LU Factorization](lu-factorization)
